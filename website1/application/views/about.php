        IShip was founded in 2016 by: Thomas Gwinn, Sheila Orongan, Diane Pantonial.
	IShip.com was created for two reasons. The first reason was for people to have a way to ship or transport anything they needed from one location to the next. 
	While insuring they get the cheapest cost AND be done by professionals while also having 100% safety and security!
	However not everyone has the means to do so by themselves, so IShip.com was created
